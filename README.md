# Shell_Project
I designed a Unix-like shell that supports I/O redirection, pipes, and subshells, capable of executing over 20 concurrent processes. I engineered robust command parsing and process management to handle up to 100 commands per session, ensuring efficient execution and resource management. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive Makefile to automate the build process, facilitating the efficient linking of object files while seamlessly integrating the parser, lexer, and shell components for a streamlined development workflow.

Due to this project being a part of the curriculum from the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science, I am unable to place my code in a public repository. If you are a recruiter looking to access this code, please
