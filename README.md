# Shell_Project
• Designed a Unix-like shell supporting I/O redirection, pipes, and subshells, capable of executing 20+ concurrent processes
• Engineered robust command parsing and process management, handling up to 100 commands per session
• Developed a comprehensive Makefile to automate the build process, facilitating efficient linking of object files and
integrating the parser, lexer, and shell components

Due to this project being a part of the curriculum from the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science, I am unable to place my code in a public repository. If you are a recruiter looking to access this code, please
